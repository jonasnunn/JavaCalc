# Overview
This project is a calculator that correctly applies order of operations to a complex mathematical expression. 

This was developed because I have never used Java before and wanted to become familiar with it's syntax. I wanted to chose a project that would require me to use a variety of common language concepts and a calculator allowed me to accomplish this.
